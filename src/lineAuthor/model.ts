 * An identifier for each line authoring.
 *
 * For every {@link LineAuthoring} there is exactly one valid corresponding {@link LineAuthoringId}
 * This is used to disambiguate differing line authoring content.
 *
 * For instance, when there are UI-changes in an editor, we want to quickly figure out
 * whether the LineAuthoring has changed as well. Computing this cache-identifiying key/id
 * allows us to quickly find that out and avoid re-computing the result, if the corresponding
 * line authoring already has been computed. This is used in lineAuthorInfoProvider.ts.
 *
 * This implementation assumes, that each {@link LineAuthoring} is unique, given
 * the HEAD revision of the git repository, the hash of the current contents of the file and
 * the path to the file within the vault. The exact syntax is determined by {@link lineAuthoringId}.
 *
 * * HEAD: This ensures, that adding a new commit or changing the checked out revision
 *      forces re-computation.
 *   * We always want to use the submodule which contains the file rather than any super-project,
 *     as the file is only committed in lowest level submodule - and only it's HEAD revision
 *     will be updated during a commit.
 * * contents-hash: Whenever the contents of the file produce a different hash,
 *      the view needs updating - hence the re-computation.
 * * the path of the file in git matters as well, as the exact file content at different
 *      paths in a git repository can have different histories
