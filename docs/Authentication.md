# macOS

## HTTPS

Run the following to use the macOS keychain to store your credentials.

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

You have to do one authentication action (clone/pull/push) after setting the helper in the terminal. After that you should be able to clone/pull/push in Obsidian without any issues.

## SSH

Remember you still have to setup ssh correctly, like adding your SSH key to the `ssh-agent`. GitHub provides a great documentation on how to [generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=mac#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and then on how to [add the SSH key to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=mac#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent).

# Windows

## HTTPS

Ensure you are using Git 2.29 or higher and you are using Git Credential Manager as a credential helper. 
You can verify this by executing the following snippet in a terminal, preferably in the directory where your vault/repository is located. It should output `manager`.

```bash
git config credential.helper
```

If this doesn't output `manager`, please run `git config set credential.helper manager`
Just execute any authentication command like push/pull/clone and a pop window should come up, allowing your to sign in.

Alternatively, you can also leave that setting empty and always provide the username and password manually via the prompted modal in Obsidian. All available credential helpers are listed [here](https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers).,

### Storing

To securely store the username and password permanently without having to reenter it all the time you can use Git's [Credential Helper](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage). `libsecret` stores the password in a secure place. On GNOME it's backed up by [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/) and on KDE by [KDE Wallet](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE_Wallet).
To set `libsecret` as your credential helper execute the following in the terminal from the directory of your vault/repository. You can also add the `--global` flag to set that setting for all other repositories on your device, too.

```bash
git config set credential.helper libsecret
```

You have to do one authentication action (clone/pull/push) after setting the helper in the terminal. After that you should be able to clone/pull/push in Obsidian without any issues.

In case you get the message `git: 'credential-libsecret' is not a git command`, libsecret is not installed on your system. You may have to install it by yourself.
Here is an example for Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev make gcc

sudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret

# NOTE: This changes your global config, in case you don't want that you can omit the `--global` and execute it in your existing git repository.
git config --global credential.helper \
   /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret

```

### SSH_PASS Tools
When Git is not connected to any terminal, so  you can't enter your username/password in the terminal, it relies on the `GIT_ASKPASS`/`SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable to provide an interface to the user to enter those values.

#### Native SSH_ASKPASS
In case you don't want to store it permanently you can install `ksshaskpass` (it's preinstalled on KDE systems) and set it as binary to ask for the password.

To use `ksshaskpass` in Obsidian as the tool for `SSH_ASKPASS` add the following line to the "Additional Environment Variables" in the plugin's settings in the "Advanced" section.

```
SSH_ASKPASS=ksshaskpass
```

You should get a new window to enter your username/password when using a Git action needing authentication now.

#### SSH_PASS integrated in Obsidian
The plugin now automatically provides an integrated script for the `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable, if no other program is set, that opens a modal in Obsidian whenever Git asks for username or password.

## SSH
With one of the above [[#SSH_PASS Tools]]  installed to enter your passphrase, you can use ssh with a passphrase. Remember you still have to setup ssh correctly, like adding your SSH key to the `ssh-agent`. GitHub provides a great documentation on how to [generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and then on how to [add the SSH key to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linuxu#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent).
