# Linux

## Obsidian installation

Known **supported** Obsidian installation methods:
- AppImage

Known **not fully supported** package managers
- Snap (Snap puts Obsidian in a kind of sandbox, so that Obsidian can't access Git)
- [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/md.obsidian.Obsidian) can access Git, but not all system files, so it's not recommended.

If you installed Obsidian a while ago via **Flatpak**, and it doesn't work, please run the following snippet.

```
$ flatpak update md.obsidian.Obsidian
$ flatpak override --reset md.obsidian.Obsidian
$ flatpak run md.obsidian.Obsidian
```
