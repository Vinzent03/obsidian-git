## UI Previews

### 🔧 Source Control View

Manage your file changes directly inside Obsidian like stage/unstage individual files and commit them.

### 📜 History View

Show the commit history of your repository. The commit message, author, date, and changed files can be shown. Author and date are disabled by default as shown in the screenshot, but can be enabled in the settings.

### 🔍 Diff View 

Compare versions with a clear and concise diff viewer.
Open it from the source control view or via the `Open diff view` command.

### 📝 Signs in the Editor

View line-by-line changes directly in the editor with added, modified, and deleted line/hunk indicators. You can stage and reset changes right from the signs. There also commands to navigate between hunks and stage/reset hunks under the cursor. Needs to be enabled in the plugin settings.

## 💻 Desktop Notes

### 🔐 Authentication

Some Git services may require further setup for HTTPS/SSH authentication. Refer to the [Authentication Guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Authentication)

### Obsidian on Linux

- ⚠️  Snap is not supported due to its sandboxing restrictions.
- ⚠️  Flatpak is not recommended, because it doesn't have access to all system files. They are actively fixing many issues, but there are still issues. Especially with more advanced setups.
- ✅ Please use AppImage or a full access installation of your system's package manager instead ([Linux installation guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Installation#Linux))

## 📱 Mobile Support (⚠️  Experimental)

The Git implementation on mobile is **very unstable**! I would not recommend using this plugin on mobile, but try other syncing services.

One such alternative is [GitSync](https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync), which is available on both Android and iOS. It is not associated with this plugin, but it may be a better option for mobile users. A tutorial for setting it up can be found [here](https://viscouspotenti.al/posts/gitsync-all-devices-tutorial).

> 🧪 The Git plugin works on mobile thanks to [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/), a JavaScript-based re-implementation of Git - but it comes with serious limitations and issues. It is not possible for an Obsidian plugin to use a native Git installation on Android or iOS.

### ❌ Mobile Feature Limitations

- No **SSH authentication** ([isomorphic-git issue](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/231))
- Limited repo size, because of memory restrictions
- No rebase merge strategy
- No submodules support

### ⚠️ Performance Caveats

> [!caution]
> Depending on your device and available free RAM, Obsidian may
>
> - crash on clone/pull
> - create buffer overflow errors
> - run indefinitely.
>
> It's caused by the underlying git implementation on mobile, which is not efficient. I don't know how to fix this. If that's the case for you, I have to admit this plugin won't work for you. So commenting on any issue or creating a new one won't help. I am sorry.

### Tips for Mobile Use:

If you have a large repo/vault I recommend to stage individual files and only commit staged files.
