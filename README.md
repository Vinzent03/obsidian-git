# Obsidian Git
Simple plugin that allows you to back up your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) vault to a remote Git repository (e.g. private repo on GitHub).

On advantages of backing up your vault with git I suggest reading this [amazing article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-i-put-my-mind-under-version-control-24caea37b8a5) by [@tallguyjenks](https://github.com/tallguyjenks).

# ⚠ Mobile

## Restrictions of the mobile version

I am using [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/), which is a re-implementation of git in JavaScript, because you cannot use native git on Android or iOS.

- SSH authentication is not supported ([isomorphic-git issue](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/231))
- Repo size is limited, because of memory restrictions
- Rebase merge strategy is not supported
- Submodules are not supported

## Performance on **Mobile**
**Setup:** iPad Pro M1 with a [repo](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git-stress-test) of 3000 files reduced from [10000 markdown files](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/10000-markdown-files)

The only really time consuming part is to check the whole working directory for file changes. So checking all files for changes to stage takes 03:40 min. Other commands like pull, push and commit are very fast (1-5 seconds). So the best way is to stage individual directories in which you have worked and commit only staged files after it.
The initial clone took 00:25 min.

### Installation on Desktop

⚠ Installing Obsidian via Snap on Linux is not supported. Please use AppImage or Flatpak instead ([Linux installation guide](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/wiki/Installation#linux))

See the [installation guide](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/wiki/Installation) for further instructions.
