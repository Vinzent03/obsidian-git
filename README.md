# Git

A Community Plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) to manage your vault with Git.

## Documentation

Requirements, installation steps (including setup for mobile), tips and tricks, common issues and more can be found in the [documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc).

For mobile users see [Mobile](#mobile) section below.

## Highlighted Features

- Automatic commit-and-sync (commit, pull and push) on a schedule.
- Pull commits from remote repository on Obsidian startup.
- Manage different repositories via Git submodules (Opt-in in settings) (Desktop only).
- Stage, commit and diff individual files via the Source Control View. Open it with the `Open Source Control View` command.
- List your commits and their changed files (like a `git log`) via the History View. Open it with the `Open History View` command.
- For viewing the detailed history of a file, I strongly recommend you the [Version History Diff](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-version-history-diff) plugin.

### Source Control View

This view allows you to stage, unstage individual files and commit them. It also shows the status of each file in your vault.

### History View

This view shows the commit history of your repository. You can see the commit message, author, date, and changed files. Author and date are disabled by default as shown in the screenshot, but can be enabled in the settings.

### Diff View 

You can open the diff view from the source control view or via an extra command.

## Desktop

## Authentication

Authentication may require additional setup. See more in the [Authentication documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Authentication)

### Obsidian on Linux

- ⚠ Snap is not supported.
- ⚠ Flatpak is not recommended, because it doesn't have access to all system files.

Please use AppImage instead ([Linux installation guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Installation#Linux))

## Mobile

The git implementation on mobile is **very unstable**!

### Restrictions

The mobile version is supported by [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/), which is a re-implementation of Git in JavaScript, because you cannot use native Git on Android or iOS.

- SSH authentication is not supported ([isomorphic-git issue](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/231))
- Repo size is limited, because of memory restrictions
- Rebase merge strategy is not supported
- Submodules are not supported

### Performance on mobile

> [!caution]
> Depending on your device and available free RAM, Obsidian may
>
> - crash on clone/pull
> - create buffer overflow errors
> - run indefinitely.
>
> It's caused by the underlying git implementation on mobile, which is not efficient. I don't know how to fix this. If that's the case for you, I have to admit this plugin won't work for you. So commenting on any issue or creating a new one won't help. I am sorry.

**Setup:** iPad Pro M1 with a [repo](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git-stress-test) of 3000 files reduced from [10000 markdown files](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/10000-markdown-files)

The initial clone took 0m25s. After that, the most time consuming part is to check the whole working directory for file changes. On this setup, checking all files for changes to stage takes 03m40s. Other commands like pull, push and commit are very fast (1-5 seconds).

The fastest way to work on mobile if you have a large repo/vault is to stage individual files and only commit staged files.

This plugin was initial developed by [denolehov](https://github.com/denolehov). Since March 2021, it's me [Vinzent03](https://github.com/Vinzent03) who is developing this plugin. That's why the GitHub repository got moved to my account in July 2024.
