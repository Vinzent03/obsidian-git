## 🖥️ UI Previews

Manage your file changes directly inside Obsidian like stage/unstage individual files and commit them.

### 📜 History View

Show the commit history of your repository. The commit message, author, date, and changed files can be shown. Author and date are disabled by default as shown in the screenshot, but can be enabled in the settings.

## 💻 Desktop Notes

### 🔐 Authentication

Some Git services may require further setup for HTTPS/SSH authentication. Refer to the [Authentication Guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Authentication)

### Obsidian on Linux

- ⚠️  Snap is not supported.
- ⚠️  Flatpak is not recommended, because it doesn't have access to all system files.
- ✅ Please use AppImage or a full access installation of your system's package manager instead ([Linux installation guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Installation#Linux))

## 📱 Mobile Support (⚠️  Experimental)

The Git implementation on mobile is **very unstable**! I would not recommend using this plugin on mobile, but try other syncing services.
> 🧪 The Git plugin works on mobile thanks to [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/), a JavaScript-based re-implementation of Git - but it comes with serious limitations and issues. It is not possible for an Obsidian plugin to use a native Git installation on Android or iOS.

### ❌ Mobile Limitations

- No **SSH authentication** ([isomorphic-git issue](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/231))
- Limited repo size, because of memory restrictions
- No rebase merge strategy
- No submodules support

### ⚠️  Performance Caveats

> [!caution]
> Depending on your device and available free RAM, Obsidian may
>
> - crash on clone/pull
> - create buffer overflow errors
> - run indefinitely.
>
> It's caused by the underlying git implementation on mobile, which is not efficient. I don't know how to fix this. If that's the case for you, I have to admit this plugin won't work for you. So commenting on any issue or creating a new one won't help. I am sorry.

**Setup:** iPad Pro M1 with a [repo](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git-stress-test) of 3000 files reduced from [10000 markdown files](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/10000-markdown-files)

The initial clone took 0m25s. After that, the most time consuming part is to check the whole working directory for file changes. On this setup, checking all files for changes to stage takes 03m40s. Other commands like pull, push and commit are very fast (1-5 seconds).

### Tips for Mobile Use:

The fastest way to work on mobile if you have a large repo/vault is to stage individual files and only commit staged files.
