âš  Installing Obsidian via Snap on Linux is not supported. Please use AppImage or Flatpak instead ([Linux installation guide](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/wiki/Installation#linux))

## Mobile

### Restrictions of the mobile version

I am using [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/), which is a re-implementation of git in JavaScript, because you cannot use native git on Android or iOS.

- SSH authentication is not supported ([isomorphic-git issue](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/231))
- Repo size is limited, because of memory restrictions
- Rebase merge strategy is not supported
- Submodules are not supported

### Performance on mobile

> **Warning**
> In cases where your device is low on RAM, Obsidian can crash on clone/pull. I don't know how to fix this. If that's the case for you, I have to admit this plugin won't work for you.

**Setup:** iPad Pro M1 with a [repo](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git-stress-test) of 3000 files reduced from [10000 markdown files](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/10000-markdown-files)


The initial clone took 0m25s. After that, the most time consuming part is to check the whole working directory for file changes. On this setup, checking all files for changes to stage takes 03m40s. Other commands like pull, push and commit are very fast (1-5 seconds). 

The fastest way to work on mobile if you have a large repo/vault is to stage individual files and only commit staged files.
